Dear Ms. Stanford,

Following your request, I have reviewed the role of Artificial Intelligence in cybersecurity. 
Current trends show that AI is a double-edged sword: while attackers increasingly use “Bad AI” 
to develop adaptive malware, bypass defenses, and launch highly targeted phishing attacks, 
“Good AI” enables organizations to respond proactively.

AI-driven security solutions can analyze vast amounts of data, detect anomalies, and even 
predict attacks before they occur. Approaches such as AI-powered threat detection, 
Zero Trust models, and automated response systems significantly reduce reaction time 
and human error. In addition, our current use of Snyk.io demonstrates how AI-based tools 
already help NovaShield Systems identify vulnerabilities early and strengthen our overall 
security posture.

However, AI adoption also comes with challenges, including higher costs, system complexity, 
and the need for transparency, ethical oversight, and skilled personnel.

In my opinion, NovaShield Systems should continue and expand its investment in AI-driven 
cybersecurity. As cyberattacks become more frequent and intelligent, proactive defense is 
no longer optional. Strategic use of AI will enhance our resilience and allow us to better 
protect our clients.

Kind regards,
