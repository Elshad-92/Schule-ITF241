Dear Ms. Stanford,

Following your request, I have reviewed the role of Artificial Intelligence in cybersecurity. 
Current developments show that AI is a double-edged sword: while attackers increasingly use 
“Bad AI” to create adaptive malware and sophisticated phishing attacks, “Good AI” enables 
organizations to defend themselves more proactively.

AI-driven security solutions can analyze large datasets, detect anomalies, and predict 
potential attacks before they occur. At NovaShield Systems, we are already benefiting 
from this approach through our use of Snyk.io, an AI-powered security tool that helps 
us continuously identify vulnerabilities in our code and cloud environments at an early 
stage. This has significantly strengthened our security posture and reduced risk for both 
our company and our clients.

There are challenges to consider, including implementation costs, system complexity, 
and the need for skilled personnel and ethical oversight. However, these challenges 
are manageable with proper strategy and training.

In my opinion, NovaShield Systems should continue to invest in AI-driven cybersecurity 
solutions. Our positive experience with Snyk.io shows that AI-based tools are an effective 
defense against increasingly intelligent cyber threats and are essential for long-term resilience.

Kind regards,
Elshad Gulaliyev
